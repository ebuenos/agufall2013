So my catechism for 2D inversion is: 
1) Model TM only first. Initially with large errors on rho and pha, then gradually reduce errors in pha, keeping errors in rho to 50% to account for static shifts. 
2) Then introduce TE. Initially with very large errors on rho (100%) and large errors on pha (20%), then gradually reduce those errors to try to get to about the same level as for prior TM (25% or 50% on rho, 5% on pha). 
3) Then introduce induction vectors, again initially with large errors (0.25), then reduce to about 0.05. 
NOW you have a model that fits most of your data, and with the statics accounted for by the large error floors on rho. You can now try step 4... 
4) Now turn on static shifts and reduce rho floors to 10% or even 5%. Have the static shift damping large to begin with (100), as it reduces by a factor of 3 ever 3 iterations. 

My experience is that sometimes step (4) wipes out all of the structure in the model, and puts it into the static shift

rms
tm = 2.3071
tmte = 2.48
tp =  1.9115



To improve the assurance of or model, we make a new MT inversion using a different procedure.
We initiate the inversion assuming large errors in the resistivity and phase, after we start to reduce the errors in phase then reduce the errors in the resistivity.
The idea of this procedure is to gradually introduce the data in the inversion.
Here we present the 2-D inversion resistivity model for the Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode using REBOCC. The RMS resistivity for this model is 2.47.
